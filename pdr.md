# üì¶ Frontend Production Deployment Roadmap (PDR)

**Project Name:** lumgoo
**Domain:** [https://lumgoo.com](https://lumgoo.com)
**Type:** Personal Portfolio Website
**Technologies:** React, Next.js, TypeScript, MobX, Jest
**Deployment Target:** Google Cloud (GKE)

---

## ‚úÖ 1. Project Structure & Page Layout

### Landing Page

- Slide section: animated transitions using dummy images (e.g., Swiper.js)
- Projects Preview: highlight projects in card layout
- About Me Summary: short bio with link to detailed page

### Other Pages

- `/projects`: List of all projects with filtering and detail links
- `/about`: Extended resume, tech stack tags, contact info

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 2. Technologies & Tooling

- **Next.js (React + TypeScript)**
- **MobX**: Global state management
- **Jest + React Testing Library**: Testing framework
- **ESLint + Prettier**: Linting and formatting
- **Makefile**: CLI commands (test, lint, coverage, build, run)
- **GitHub Actions**: CI pipeline (lint, test, coverage, build)
- **All source code and comments must be in English.**

---

## üìù 3. Development Rules

- Main branches (`main` / `master`) are protected; direct push is not allowed
- All contributions must be via Pull Request (PR)
- Merge strategy: **Squash and Merge** only
- CI pipeline must pass before PRs can be merged
- Minimum test coverage is 75%; below this will cause CI to fail
- PR template is mandatory: must include description, screenshots, and test status

---

## üöÄ 4. Roadmap

### Docker Integration

- [x] Dockerfile for production build and export is prepared
- [x] NGINX serves static export from Next.js
- [x] `.dockerignore` excludes unnecessary files from the image
- [x] Docker image pushed to GCP Artifact Registry
- [x] Docker build/test integrated into CI pipeline

### Phase 1: Initial Setup

- [x] Initialized with `create-next-app` and TypeScript
- [x] Configured MobX with root store and context
- [x] Created routes: `/`, `/projects`, `/about`
- [x] Implemented dummy slider component and page content

### Phase 2: Testing & Lint Infrastructure

- [x] Setup Jest and React Testing Library
- [x] Wrote Given-When-Then style test cases
- [x] Added coverage threshold rule: minimum 75%
- [x] ESLint and Prettier configured and added to scripts

### Phase 3: CI/CD

- [x] GitHub Actions pipeline: lint ‚Üí test ‚Üí coverage ‚Üí build
- [x] CI passing is required to merge PR
- [x] Coverage badge integrated
- [x] Branch protection enabled

### Phase 4: Docker & GCP Deployment

- [x] Dockerfile serves Next.js static export via NGINX
- [x] Docker image pushed to GCP Artifact Registry
- [x] Kubernetes deployment, service, ingress YAML files created
- [x] Domain routed via Godaddy, TLS via Let's Encrypt

## ‚ú® 5. Quality Standards

| Criteria             | Target      |
| -------------------- | ----------- |
| Test coverage        | ‚â• 75%       |
| ESLint errors        | 0           |
| Merge strategy       | Squash only |
| CI pipeline duration | < 3 minutes |

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Makefile Example

```makefile
start:
	npm run dev

test:
	npm run test

lint:
	npx eslint .

coverage:
	npm run test -- --coverage

build:
	npm run build
```

---

## üß™ Test Style (Given / When / Then)

```tsx
// example.test.tsx

describe("ExampleComponent", () => {
  it("renders the correct title", () => {
    // Given
    const title = "Hello World";

    // When
    render(<ExampleComponent title={title} />);

    // Then
    expect(screen.getByText(title)).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

---

## üìÅ Config Files & Environment Management

### .env and .env.example

- `.env`: Contains actual secrets and environment variables (excluded from Git)
- `.env.example`: Reference template for expected variables

```env
# .env.example
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID=
```

### GCP Integration

- Environment variables managed via `.env`
- CI/CD pipeline auto-loads variables for deploy
- Optionally integrated with Google Secret Manager

---

## üìÑ README.md Contents (Planned)

- Project Overview
- Technologies Used
- Installation Steps
- CLI Commands (npm + makefile)
- Environment Variables
- Test & Lint Instructions
- CI/CD Pipeline Summary
- Deployment Guide (Docker & GCP)
